    "selftext": "I have been strength training for 10 years. Very experienced at all the barbell lifts. Basically for the past decade I've successfully run strength and bodybuilding programs and been proud of my attention to strength training.\nI've struggled with diet and never really lost the fat. I'm not looking for advice there. Period. \nFor the past 6 months I've struggled with motivation. I've tried the following:\nMaking a 3 to 5 day a week routine with lifts I enjoy doing.\nMAPS (the one where you do 15 minutes a day)\n2 days a week of lifting plus 2 days a week of Barre\nTaking 2 weeks off\nWorking out at a different time of day (I work out early morning)\n\nI just dread going to lift. I have a nice home gym. Going to a gym or working with a trainer is not financially feasible, and getting a workout partner won't happen (I live rural).\n\nI am going thru menopause and have gained 15 lbs which is depressing. A lot of it is water retention that comes and goes. My diet hasn't changed, if anything I eat less from GLP 1s. My energy is decent. I've been walking 10k steps every day for the last month. My sleep is good. I have a lot of aches and pains here and there. Brain fog is awful. \n\nOn the diet side, I do my best to favor protein. I'm a minimum 90 to 100 grams a day and eat around 1500 calories a day. I try to get to 130 grams of protein a day. I eat good clean sources. And yes... I track. \n\nAny thoughts? I'm getting depressed. I know how good lifting is for me, and how much I used to LOVE it. I mean, I am a \"never skip a workout\" gal. But now, just ready to give it up and sit on the couch and get fat and weak. \n\nI would just love some ideas of how to get back to it and find that love again. ",

    "selftext": "I recently came across a regional YouTuber who calls himself \"science-based\" and frequently cites biomechanics to explain proper exercise form. One of his bold claims is that skull crushers are a bad exercise and should be avoided entirely ‚Äî even if you're not experiencing elbow pain now, he insists you eventually will.\n\nHe supports his argument by saying that skull crushers go against the natural movement pattern of the elbow. According to him, the elbow joint has an asymmetrical cylindrical shape, which means it‚Äôs meant to move in a diagonal plane. But no matter what equipment you use ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs a barbell, EZ bar, or dumbbells ‚Äî once the weight gets heavy, gravity forces your arms to move in a strict sagittal plane.\n\nHe claims this misalignment causes medial and lateral stress on the elbows, eventually leading to elbow-related issues.\n\nHow valid is this claim? Is this just another case of fear-mongering, or is there actually some solid biomechanical reasoning behind it?",
